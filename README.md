# Assess-Candidates

### Idea 
1. In HR portal the shortlisted mails will be send to the backend
2. Candidate login credentials and questions based on their resume is to be created and stored in DB (refer shortlist_candidate.py file in hra)
3. Here for each candidate , candidate specific dynamic web page is created containing descriptive questions
4. The response from candidate is taken and candidate response and gpt response are compared using semantic similarity
5. semantic similarity is also the score that a candidate gets for his/her response.
6. The candidate answer and score both are stored in the database for future reference

From point 2 till 6 everything is DONE !
